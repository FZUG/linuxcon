Basically there's a technology side and
简单来说 (Fedora 社区) 有技术与人员两个方面，而且我认为二者发展都很强势。
01:33
a people side and I think they're both
01:34
very strong. I think Fedora we do really
01:37
try and follow the leading edge of open
我认为我们确实尝试并且跟随开源的先进性，并且为开源做出付出。
01:39
source technology and commitment to the
01:42
open source part of that. and it's not
01:45
just ---it not just that--- it's the bleeding
01:47
edge but we try to make sure we're
并且我们不仅仅跟随先进的开源技术，并且也把它们做得对用户更有用。
01:48
following the leading edge of
01:50
exciting stuff but also getting it to
01:51
people in a useful way. so I think that's
01:53
appealing. it's a kind of fun stuff to
因此我认为这个非常具有吸引力。
01:55
work on at the operating system level so
01:57
that that's neat. but also this is a
02:00
really amazing group of people and you
02:03
know we've got thousands of people who
02:05
contribute every year
02:07
two or three thousand people to some level.
02:09
and a core group of you know maybe four
02:11
or five hundred people who are working
02:13
every week on the project and they're
02:15
really great generous people who have a
02:17
real passion for the things we're
02:19
working on so I think that's pretty
02:21
appealing - it's fun - 
02:25
I happily install most of the any of the nonviolent games
02:27
in the Fedora repository on our
02:29
systems and I'm like how that is.
02:34
The major part of Fedora where is what I love about
02:36
is it's a bleeding edge so I get the
02:38
latest in the greatest of whatever that
02:40
I want. so be it building bleeding edge
02:43
stuff on IOT or build big data I have
02:47
whatever tools that I require in that to
02:50
make sure my project is up and running.
02:52
one of the things that I think is
02:53
critical about Fedora that we are doing
02:56
a better and better job messaging on this.
02:58
the Fedora community is way more than
03:01
the production of the operating system
03:03
there's a lot of things to do and you
03:05
can get involved in them you know there
03:06
isn't like territorialism like you can
03:08
contribute to this component only we
03:10
contribute this components. I think
03:12
Fedora values the contributors. the thing
03:15
that I think is really important about
03:17
Fedora is we provide a facility for
03:20
people to do what they want to do and
03:22
they can get a lot of support from their
03:24
fellow community members because we
03:25
bring the right kinds of people together.
03:27
and I think the the amazing thing for me
03:30
is not just how many old faces I still
03:33
see that are here, but how many new faces
03:35
I see, and how important it is to the
03:38
community to get people involved in and
03:40
get out of their way. and I think there's
03:43
not just the common sense of shared
03:46
purpose towards building Fedora the
03:48
operating system and the distribution
03:49
and making sure that our users are are
03:52
happy. but there's this short there's a
03:55
shared understanding that we're all
03:57
people we're all flawed we all have
03:59
something to bring to the table and so
04:01
with let's come and talk and and figure
04:03
out you know what needs to happen what
04:05
we can do, and you know everybody sees
04:08
everybody else has important I think
04:10
it's a very unique a very unique
04:13
experience everybody's kind of at the
04:14
same level here.
04:16
it's great. the community by far I mean
04:20
people are the people I work with are
04:23
some of the smartest people I know
04:24
they're very resourceful they're they're
04:27
nice I mean I just I can't say enough
04:29
about it I just I love the community
04:30
it's like a family. Fedora, I will say
04:34
like anyone who is coming to the fedora
04:36
so he will not feel that there is not
04:38
for him anything. so there is for
04:42
everyone there is something in Fedora.
04:44
so it's a it's it's passionate but very
04:47
friendly. and you see that especially in
04:50
flock I mean it's a really a really
04:51
technical group of people that like
04:53
working together and love working on
04:55
what they work on and it's a fun place
04:57
to be ---it's it's what---. I could easily see
05:01
how passionate people were not just
05:04
about the work that they were doing but
05:07
also about supporting each other as they
05:11
can empowering an inclusive community to
05:13
build better software together. let's say
05:17
the community it's one of the main
05:19
reasons why I'm still part of it because
05:22
they are really friendly there. they are
05:25
really friendly to the newcomers
05:27
especially. so you feel really welcomed
05:30
at the community because you know when
05:33
you go to a community to a new community
05:36
and you want to be part of it, first of
05:38
all you are afraid that someone might
05:41
say "okay but you don't know this
05:43
question?" but not at all. they will be
05:46
really friendly with you they they will
05:48
support you for everything that you
05:51
might need. and they will show you even
05:54
the right direction where to go and
05:57
which teams you can be inside. large
05:59
community of people who kind of use open
06:02
source as an excuse to change the world
06:03
which that's an easy thing to say. but we
06:06
do it a lot through non-code
06:08
contributions we have a huge outreach
06:10
program we have huge marketing
06:11
opportunities writing opportunities
06:13
there's ways for people to become
06:15
involved in the ideals of open source
06:17
even if they choose not to actually
06:19
commit a line of what we as engineers
06:21
would call source
06:24
